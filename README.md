# blue-green-develpoment
This project demonstrates a Blue-Green Deployment strategy for a simple containerized web application using Docker Compose. The goal is to deploy the next version of the application in a separate container and switch traffic only when the new version is ready. Additionally, this setup simulates a basic CI/CD pipeline with Docker Compose.
